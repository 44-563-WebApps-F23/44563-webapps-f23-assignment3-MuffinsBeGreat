            <pre>The selectors here are specific to Wufoo markup, but the concepts at work can
work for any form. The overall idea is that you make the default radio buttons 
and checkboxes invisible by setting their opacity to zero, and replace them 
with graphics. Then use the :checked selector to alternate the graphics 
between their checked and unchecked versions.

                /*
                  Hide the original radios and checkboxes
                  (but still accessible)
                
                  :not(#foo) > is a rule filter to block browsers
                  that don't support that selector from
                  applying rules they shouldn't
                
                */

                  opacity: 0;
                
                  float: left;
                  width: 18px;
                }
